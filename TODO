High Priority:
BUG: what is the 3rd AddType test it shows same error as the 2nd test - no point to that test

TEST: test output parameter as a structure array
TEST: test input parameter as a reference array
TEST: test output parameter as a reference array
TEST: test POD array as member in a struct
TEST: test struct array as member in a struct
TEST: test POD reference array as member in a struct
TEST: test struct reference array as member in a struct

Medium Priority:
FUNCTION: error handling run out of memory when adding new function or new type e.g. array limit reached

CORE: error handling run out of memory when adding new string e.g. array limit reached

LES: need good debugging ability for the packets before sent and at server end
LES: send packet data to server?

Low Priority:
MACROS: WORK OUT HOW TO DO THE RETURN VALUE IN MACROS
MACROS: WORK OUT HOW TO DO THE ERROR HANDLING 

FUNCTION: how will output parameters work? Do they need to be sent to the server (yes i.e. in/out params)

CORE: memory management for input & output parameter blocks per function
CORE: hash table with binary search

LES: need to list the data storage that is required by the global data
LES: server send global test data instead of building it internally?
LES: might want to save ptr values for later instead of taking the value from them?????????????

FEATURE: make pod types alias to byte[sizeOfDataType], so byte is the final base pure type, waste of CPU cycles
