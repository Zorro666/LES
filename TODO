High Priority:
TEST: dump function data debug command
LES_FUNCDATA.PY: fully implement parseXML()
LES_FUNCDATA.PY: fully implement writeFile()
LES_DEFINITIIONFILE.PY: add function parameter definitions to binary data and XML parsing
TEST: load and use definition file (type, string, structures, functions)
TEST: load and use definition file: do not allow local C++ creation of new data (type, string, structures, functions)

Medium Priority:
SERVER: up and running ready for client to connect
CLIENT: connect to server

CLIENT: use definition file (type, string, structures, functions) from over the network

CLIENT: send function data to server as network message
SERVER: process function data send response
CLIENT: support for async function calls, error queue, potential threading issues
SERVER: support for async function calls, error queue

LES_TYPEDATA.PY: in the future have a global parameters block e.g. pointer data size default
LES_STRUCTDATA.PY: struct creation have global for packing amount

FUNCTION: error handling run out of memory when adding new function or new type e.g. array limit reached

CORE: error handling run out of memory when adding new string e.g. array limit reached

LES: need good debugging ability for the packets before sent and at server end
LES: send packet data to server?

Low Priority:
MACROS: WORK OUT HOW TO DO THE RETURN VALUE IN MACROS
MACROS: WORK OUT HOW TO DO THE ERROR HANDLING 

FUNCTION: how will output parameters work? Do they need to be sent to the server (yes i.e. in/out parameters)

CORE: memory management for input & output parameter blocks per function
CORE: hash table with binary search

LES: need to list the data storage that is required by the global data
LES: server send global test data instead of building it internally?
LES: might want to save pointer values for later instead of taking the value from them?????????????
