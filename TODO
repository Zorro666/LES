High Priority:
STRUCTDATA.PY: dump struct data debug
STRUCTDATA.PY: add write File 
STRUCTDATA.PY: add XML parse
TEST: dump struct data debug command
TEST: compute the struct size in EndStruct and ERROR if not the same as the definition
TEST: compute the struct size in EndStruct and update the type definition
SERVER: add struct defintiions to binary data and XML parsing
TEST: use definition file with struct definitions in it
TEST: dump function data debug command
TEST: remove ownsmemory mess in les_function.{cpp,h}

Medium Priority:
SERVER: up and running ready for client to connect
CLIENT: connect to server

CLIENT: use definition file (type, string, structs) from over the network
SERVER: add function defintiions to binary data and XML parsing
CLIENT: use definition file (type, string, structs, functions) from over the network
PYTHON: somehow the struct size could/should be computed on the server size 

SERVER: at some point test and implement endian swapping for the binary data
CLIENT: test endian swapped binary data

CLIENT: send function data to server as network message
SERVER: process function data send response
CLIENT: support for async function calls, error queue, potential threading issues
SERVER: support for async function calls, error queue

LES_TYPEDATA.PY: in the future have a global params block e.g. pointer data size default

FUNCTION: error handling run out of memory when adding new function or new type e.g. array limit reached

CORE: error handling run out of memory when adding new string e.g. array limit reached

LES: need good debugging ability for the packets before sent and at server end
LES: send packet data to server?

Low Priority:
MACROS: WORK OUT HOW TO DO THE RETURN VALUE IN MACROS
MACROS: WORK OUT HOW TO DO THE ERROR HANDLING 

FUNCTION: how will output parameters work? Do they need to be sent to the server (yes i.e. in/out params)

CORE: memory management for input & output parameter blocks per function
CORE: hash table with binary search

LES: need to list the data storage that is required by the global data
LES: server send global test data instead of building it internally?
LES: might want to save ptr values for later instead of taking the value from them?????????????
