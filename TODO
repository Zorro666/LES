High Priority:
MACROS: Store the output parameter - memcpy into preallocated buffer
LES: need to test memcpy of output parameter data into buffer
TODO: need to list the tests need to be added

Medium Priority:
LES: need to change name to test function with specific settings e.g. input=1, output=1, void
MACROS: WORK OUT HOW TO DO THE RETURN VALUE IN MACROS
LES: tests - need tests for each fail case that is tested for
LES: need to add fake output
LES: tests - test input/output parameter is a ptr (to a structure)

Low Priority:
LES: how will output parameters work? Do they need to be sent to the server (yes i.e. in/out params)
MACROS: WORK OUT HOW TO DO THE ERROR HANDLING 
LES: need common error handling & log system
LES: need to list the data storage that is required by the global data
TEST: error handling run out of memory when adding new function or new string e.g. array limit reached
LES: memory management for input & output parameter blocks per function
LES: hash table with binary search
LES: need good debugging ability for the packets before sent and at server end
