High Priority:
PYTHON: check the python output from the tests - should be same output as C++ version
CLIENT: change to/from BigEndian functions to take an output ptr & input ptr, to save double memcpys
CLIENT: missing final RPC function send message (it doesn't get sent by network thread)

Medium Priority:
CLIENT: support for async function calls, error queue, potential threading issues
SERVER: support for async function calls, error queue

LES_TYPEDATA.PY: in the future have a global parameters block e.g. pointer data size default
LES_STRUCTDATA.PY: struct creation have global for packing amount in the XML

LES: need good debugging ability for the packets before sent and at server end
LES: send packet data to server?

Low Priority:
MUTEX: put thread ID into it, then lock on same thread is ignored?
CLIENT: input thread needs mutex before adding network items, network items should only be added on main thread
CLIENT: rand() need a random function
MACROS: WORK OUT HOW TO DO THE RETURN VALUE IN MACROS
MACROS: WORK OUT HOW TO DO THE ERROR HANDLING 

FUNCTION: how will output parameters work? Do they need to be sent to the server (yes i.e. in/out parameters)

CORE: memory management for input & output parameter blocks per function
CORE: hash table with binary search

LES: need to list the data storage that is required by the global data
LES: might want to save pointer values for later instead of taking the value from them?????????????
